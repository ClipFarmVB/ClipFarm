# Model evaluation harness (CF-55 / CF-56 / CF-98)

A fixed benchmark for answering one question objectively: **is the clip model
getting better or worse across versions?**

Two modes, two different questions, two separate fixtures:

| Mode | Question | Fixture | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| default | are the **highlights** it clips the right ones? | `fixtures/{test_id}.json` | this file |
| `--mode deadtime` | does **condense** cut dead time without cutting play? | `fixtures/{test_id}_deadtime.json` | [`fixtures/README_deadtime.md`](fixtures/README_deadtime.md) |

**Working on condense / dead-time?** Read
[`fixtures/README_deadtime.md`](fixtures/README_deadtime.md) first — the tier
semantics differ from the highlight fixture in a way that silently inverts the
metric if you get it wrong (see [Adding a new test case](#adding-a-new-test-case)).

It is *not* a clipper. It takes a video the pipeline has already processed, plus
a human's hand-labeled highlights for that same video, and scores how closely
the model's clips match the human's — as a small set of threshold-free numbers.
Because the video and labels never change, the **delta between two tagged runs**
is attributable to the model change. Absolute values matter far less than the
trend.

## The four signals

Computed by `metrics.py` (pure interval arithmetic — no matching rules, no
arbitrary overlap cliffs). Let `H` = union of human-labeled intervals,
`M` = union of all model windows, `W` = a single model window.

| Signal | Meaning | Better |
|---|---|---|
| **Captured %** | `|M ∩ H| / |H|` — share of human highlight seconds the model covered | higher |
| **Play buckets** | per human clip, capture fraction `f = |h ∩ M| / |h|`; counts of **well-captured** (`f ≥ 0.5`) / **butchered** (`0 < f < 0.5`) / **missed** (`f = 0`) | more well |
| **Incorrect time** | model seconds *outside* the highlights, split into **junk** (windows touching no highlight), **lead slop** / **tail slop** (before/after the clips a window hits), **bridge** (uncovered gap between two highlights one window spans) | lower |
| **Score AUC** | P(a highlight-overlapping window scores above a junk window), using `highlight_score` | higher (0.5 = blind) |

The only threshold anywhere is the `0.5` well-captured bucket — a *reporting*
cut over already-computed fractions, not part of the measurement.

### Pre-gate vs post-gate — read both
Every run reports the signals twice:
- **pre-gate** — all detected rallies, *before* `highlight_score_threshold`.
- **post-gate** — only the clips that survived the gate.

The pair localizes a regression:
- Coverage lost **pre-gate** → a **detection** problem (the rally was never found). Lowering the threshold won't help.
- Coverage lost **only post-gate** → a **scoring/threshold** problem (found but gated out).

These need opposite fixes, so always compare the two.

### Interpretation notes
- **Lead/tail slop** is *expected* near the design pads (`PRE_RALLY_PAD ≈ 2s`,
  `POST_PLAY_PAD ≈ 2.5s` in `ml/pipeline/ball.py`) — the pads are deliberate.
  The signal to watch is slop *beyond* them (e.g. tail slop averaging ~8s/clip
  is the dead-tail regression class).
- **Junk time** is the multi-court / false-positive tracer.
- **AUC = 0.5** means `highlight_score` can't tell highlights from junk; it's the
  metric that moves when scoring weights are tuned.

## Running it

Both modes need a *processed* game (the model's clips must exist). Run from the
repo root; the `--offline` mode must run where the pipeline deps live (the
worker container).

```bash
# Offline: replay detection + scoring from the R2 ball-cache (no re-tracking).
docker compose exec -e GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) worker \
  python -m ml.eval.harness --test test1 --version my-change --offline

# Clips-json: score a pre-dumped {pre_gate, post_gate} window list.
python -m ml.eval.harness --test test1 --version my-change --clips-json dump.json

# Dead-time: score a dumped condense keep-window list. No video, no app deps —
# runs on a laptop.
python -m ml.eval.harness --mode deadtime --test test1 --version my-change \
  --windows-json keep.json

# Dead-time, offline: derive the windows from the real video via the R2
# ball-cache, mirroring the pipeline's stage-5 condense path.
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  worker python -m ml.eval.harness --mode deadtime --test test1 \
  --version my-change --offline
```

- `--version <label>` is free text; it and a `config_snapshot` (pad/score
  constants) + git commit are written with each run.
- `--no-record` prints without appending to the results log.
- Results append one JSON line per run to `results/{test_id}.jsonl` — or
  `results/{test_id}_deadtime.jsonl` in dead-time mode (both committed to git —
  those files *are* the cross-version history).
- Dead-time extras: `--audit-limit N` caps each divergence list (0 = all), and
  `--dump-windows` on an `--offline` run saves the derived windows so a later
  re-score needs no container and no download.

`--clips-json` input shape:
```json
{
  "pre_gate":  [{"start": "01:30", "end": "02:01", "highlight_score": 0.7}],
  "post_gate": [{"start": "01:30", "end": "02:01", "highlight_score": 0.7}]
}
```

## Adding a new test case

1. Label the raw video per the protocol in **CF-56** — the essentials:
   - Label from the **raw video, never the app's clips** (labeling off model
     output makes coverage circular — the model can't be penalized for plays it
     never surfaced).
   - Mark **tight action spans** (first meaningful touch → point end), *not*
     padded clip boundaries. The harness measures slop drift against the pads.
   - One labeler per fixture, named in the file.
2. Drop a `fixtures/{test_id}.json` file (format below). Adding a case needs
   **no code change**.
3. Run the harness with `--test {test_id}` to record its baseline.

### …for dead-time mode

A dead-time case is a **separate label pass** into
`fixtures/{test_id}_deadtime.json` — full format in
[`fixtures/README_deadtime.md`](fixtures/README_deadtime.md). Do not reuse the
highlight fixture's `clips` list.

The trap worth stating here, because nothing errors when you hit it: `keep_tiers`
selects which tiers count as **ball-in-play**, and that is a wider set than
"highlight-worthy" — `M`/`C`/`N` are all live ball (a failed serve is still play
the condense stage must keep), while only `B` (break) and `O` (camera outlier)
become dead time. Reusing the highlight tiers `["M", "C"]` would count every
boring-but-real rally as dead time, so a model that correctly kept them scores as
*missing dead time* and one that aggressively cut real play scores as *removing
more* — the metric inverts.

`load_deadtime_fixture` is deliberately permissive: an absent `keep_tiers`, or a
span with no tier, counts as in-play. A tier-less fixture therefore loads
without complaint and scores every labeled span as play. Silent, plausible, and
wrong — so copy the dead-time format rather than adapting the highlight one.

### Fixture format — `fixtures/{test_id}.json`
```json
{
  "test_id": "test1",
  "labeler": "Kunyuan",
  "labeling": "independent",
  "source_video_md5": "<content MD5 — matches the ball-cache key>",
  "source_r2_key": "raw/<game_id>.mp4",
  "video_duration_sec": 3660.0,
  "ground_truth_tiers": ["M", "C"],
  "clips": [
    { "start": "03:00", "end": "03:06", "tier": "M", "note": "spike" }
  ]
}
```
`start`/`end` accept `mm:ss`, `hh:mm:ss`, or raw seconds. Pin the video by
**content MD5**, not `game_id` — game rows get deleted; the hash identifies the
exact bytes forever and matches the ball-cache key.

## Retraining the learned condenser (CF-173)

`ml/pipeline/dead_time_ml.py` derives keep-windows from a per-second in-play
classifier instead of the `dead_time.py` thresholds. Its weights are committed
(`ml/pipeline/deadtime_ml_weights.json`) and regenerated by `train_deadtime.py`
from the **dead-time fixtures** — the same ground truth the harness scores
against.

```bash
# one-time per fixture: put its ball track where the trainer can read it
#   ball-cache/{md5}-{model}-s{sample_every}.json  →  ml/eval/ball_caches/{md5}.json
# (gitignored; sample_every is round(fps/3), so 60fps footage lands on s20)

python -m ml.eval.train_deadtime --fixtures test2 test4         # retrain + rewrite weights
python -m ml.eval.train_deadtime --fixtures test2 test4 --no-write   # report only
```

Validation is **leave-one-game-out**: each fixture takes a turn held out, the
model trains on the rest, and its decision threshold is picked on the training
games only — so every reported number comes from footage the model never saw.
Each fold prints the rule-based baseline beside it, because "better than the
rules on an unseen gym" is the bar that matters. Seconds within one game are
nearly identical, so splitting *by game* is the only split that measures what we
care about; a random per-second split would score ~perfectly and mean nothing.

A fixture needs `source_frame_height` (the tracking space of its ball cache) —
pixel-derived features are normalized by it so 360p and 1080p games share one
feature space.

The trainer always writes `"validated": false`. Flip it by hand only when the
LOGO report justifies it; `load_weights()` warns while it is false, and
`condense_use_ml` should stay off until then.

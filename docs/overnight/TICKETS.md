# Step 3 — ticket work

Read on a lap that **implements a ticket**, and whenever a card needs filing. Only reachable in `build` mode.

Part of the unattended-run brief — see [`README.md`](./README.md).

| file | when to read it |
|---|---|
| [`START.md`](./START.md) | once, at the start of a run |
| [`RULES.md`](./RULES.md) | **every iteration** |
| [`REVIEW.md`](./REVIEW.md) | a lap that reviews a PR |
| [`FIX.md`](./FIX.md) | a lap that fixes findings |
| [`TICKETS.md`](./TICKETS.md) | a lap that implements a ticket |
| [`REPORTING.md`](./REPORTING.md) | end of the run |
| [`RATIONALE.md`](./RATIONALE.md) | optional background |

#### Step 3 — ticket work

**3 — Only when 1 and 2 are clear**, take one ticket from "This run".

**This step does not run in `review-only` mode**, and neither does anything under
[Working a ticket](#working-a-ticket). Everything else below still does — in
particular [Filing cards](#filing-cards-for-out-of-scope-findings), because
reviewing is exactly when out-of-scope problems surface, and the 6-card cap
applies in both modes.

### Working a ticket

1. **Plan first.** Read the card and the code it touches. Write the plan into the
   log: approach, files, migration if any, tests, and what could go wrong.
2. **Cross-check the plan before implementing.** Spawn a subagent to review it
   against the actual repository, looking for stale assumptions about repo state,
   a migration number that collides, tests or CI steps that already exist, and
   anything the plan asserts without verifying. Record what it said — including
   when it disagreed and you proceeded anyway, with your reasoning.
3. **Implement** on a branch named for the card.
4. **Run the full gate.** Every step `ci.yml` runs:

   ```
   ruff check api/
   mypy api/app --ignore-missing-imports
   ruff check ml/eval
   mypy ml/eval --ignore-missing-imports --explicit-package-bases --namespace-packages
   python -m pytest ml/tests/
   cd api && python -m pytest tests/
   ```

   For web changes, all three — the test step is easy to forget:

   ```
   npm run lint --workspace=web
   npm run typecheck --workspace=web
   npm run test --workspace=web
   ```

   **On tool versions.** `ci.yml` installs `ruff mypy pytest` **unpinned**, so CI
   resolves whatever is latest on the day it runs. That means there is no pinned
   version to match — the closest you can get is installing the same unpinned way
   CI does, which the environment's setup script now handles. Do not claim a gate
   matches CI's tooling; state the versions you actually ran in the report.

   This is not a detail. The first run's reviews were checked with different
   `ruff`/`mypy` than CI used, which the agent flagged against its own work —
   CF-92 (#255) exists to pin them. **Once that lands, match the pinned versions
   and drop this caveat.**

   Do not open a PR if any gate fails — log it and move on.
5. **Open a draft PR** following `.github/pull_request_template.md`, including
   the bare `Closes #<issue>` line `CLAUDE.md` requires. Then go back to step 1:
   a PR you just opened has no review yet, and getting it reviewed — by a cold
   subagent, never by you — is your job. Draft status does not exempt it.

**Size discipline.** If a ticket would produce a diff too large to review in one
sitting, do not implement it. Write the plan into the log instead — a good plan
beats a half-finished 2000-line PR.

### Filing cards for out-of-scope findings

You will notice real problems that do not belong in the work at hand. File those
rather than fixing them inline or letting them evaporate.

**File** for: a bug, a security issue, a stale comment that would mislead the next
reader, missing coverage on something that matters, a premise no longer true, or
work a review surfaced that is bigger than that PR.

**Do not file** for: vague code smells, style preferences, or anything fixable
inline in under a minute.

- Title `CF-<n> · <what it is>`. Get `<n>` from the **highest existing CF number**
  across all issues — it has drifted from the issue numbers, so do not infer it.
- Match the house style of existing cards: what, why it matters, evidence with
  file and line references, options where there is a real choice, acceptance.
  CF-224 (#224) and CF-239 (#242) are good models.
- Labels from the existing set, including a priority.
- **Do not try to add the card to the `ClipFarm Backlog` project — a project
  workflow adds new issues automatically, with `Status: Todo`.** Verified: every
  card the first unattended run filed reached the board this way, without the
  `project` scope. Nor is there anything to do about **Sprint**: iteration
  fields are untouched by GitHub's built-in workflows, so it starts unset, which
  is what these cards want — they are for triage, not for silently joining the
  current sprint.

  So **do not report cards as missing from the board.** Every run so far has
  reported that, and it has been wrong each time. If you want to check rather
  than assume, `gh project item-list` reads with `project` scope; if you do not
  have it, say the board was unverified rather than saying the cards are off it.
- Open the body with: `Filed unattended during an overnight run — needs triage.`

### When a command is not available

You may be running in a sandbox rather than on a maintainer's machine. Docker in
particular may be absent, so anything needing `docker compose` — the local stack,
the eval harness — simply cannot run.

**Log that it could not run, and move on. Never report a gate as passing when you
could not execute it.** If a ticket's verification is impossible in the
environment you are in, write the plan and the reason into the log instead of
opening a PR.
